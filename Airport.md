## Maps

For anyone unfortunate enough to be taking a flight, one of the biggest
concerns on their mind might be, “Will my plane be delayed?” Such a
possibility is frustratingly common and worse, unpredictable

On the *slightly* brighter side, we can at least tell which flights have
historically been delayed more often than most, be it due to weather,
traffic, or any other obstruction.

Here is a map of flights to and from Austin-Bergstrom International
Airport. Several high-risk flights stand out in red.

Compare that to how common flights to each destination are, and you can
see that the most-delayed flights are not the most common to occur.

## Cancellations

Worse than a flight being delayed is a complete cancellation. See the
plots below for the times were flights have historically been cancelled
most often, grouped by each airline.
